==Dot=={description="Marion Estelle (Dot) Edison (1873-1965) was the oldest child of TAE and Mary Stilwell. Edison gave her the nickname 'Dot' as a child. Between 1883 and 1888 she attended private schools in New York and Massachusetts.  In 1889, she left school to join her step-aunts Mary Emily Miller and Grace Miller in Paris. She came back to the United States in 1892 but returned to Europe the following year. She married Oscar Oeser, a German army officer, on October 1, 1895 and lived in Germany for the next thirty years. Their marriage began to deteriorate during World War I. They divorced in 1921. She returned to the United States in 1925 and lived first in East Orange, New Jersey and then in Norwalk, Connecticut."} introduced me to a new day at 5:30 am.

must have charge of this branch of the vegitable kingdom. It has just occured to me that the brain may digest certain portions of the food, say the etherial part, as well as the stomach—perhaps dandruff is the excreta of the mind—the quantity of this material being directly proportional to the amount of reading one indulges in. A book on German metaphysics would thus easily ruin a dress suit. After breakfast start reading Hawthorne's English Note Book dont think much of it. perhaps Im a literary barbarian and am not eyet educated up to the point of appreciating fine writing— 90 per cent of his book is descriptive of old churches and graveyards and coronors He and Geo Selwyn ought to have been appointed perpetual coroners of London. Two fine things in the book were these. Hawthorne shewing to little Rose Hawthorne a big live lobster told her it was a very ugly thing and would bite everybody, whereupon she asked "if the first one God made, bit him" again "Ghostland is beyond the jurisdiction of veracity" I think freckles on the skin are due to some salt of Iron, sunlight brings them out by reducing them from high to low state of oxidation—perhaps with a powerful magnet applied for some time, and then with proper chemicals, these mud holes of beauty might be removed.

The frequency of their reception will confirm or disaffirm my conjectures as to the proximity of a serious catastrophe— A post office courtship is a novelty to me, so I have resolved to follow up this matter for the experience which I will obtain— This may come handy should "My head ever become the dupe of my heart" as Papa Rochefacauld puts it.— In evening went out on sea wall—noticed a strange phosphorecent light in the west, probably caused by a baby moon just going down Chinaward■thought at first the Aurora Boreallis had moved out west— Went to bed early dreamed of [deamon?]d Demon with eyes four hundred feet apart.
